======================  OR additional exercise 2 https://pastebin.com/jyavmzmv
Create a new project in the usual way. Add a class called Image.
Decide what properties an image needs. 
Example properties: filename, category, photographer and description 
Declare all the properties as private and choose suitable data types for the properties (e.g. filename would be a String)
Generate getters and setters for all the properties
To do this, right-click a property and choose 'generate > getter and setter'

Write a public method called 'showFullPath' that returns a String
The method takes no arguments and derives a default path for images
Inside this method, return a full path like this:
  return "data/gallery/" + this.filename + ".jpg";
(this matches the actual location of some genuine images)

Write a second public method also called 'showFullPath' taking one argument
The argument represents a custom path, to be concatenated with the filename, e.g.
  return newPath + this.filename + ".jpg"; // note the default jpg

The third public method (also called 'showFullPath') takes two arguments representing
a custom path and a custom file-type. Return the full path e.g.
  return newPath + this.filename + newFileType;

Write one last public method called 'showDetails' taking no arguments.
Inside the method, use System.out.println to show image details and default full path

Now return to the main class. Create a new image instance (choose a name)
Add the following properties to this image instance:
  filename: animals03
  photographer: Emily Kim
  category: animals
  description: chubby donkey
Call the 'showDetails' method and run so you see the details of an image
