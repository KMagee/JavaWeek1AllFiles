Java review exercise 1 see https://pastebin.com/yisz0bzk
====================== until about 2:00 ish (maybe before)	
Generate a random number (0-9) for the user to guess in five tries.

Create a new project from the template, with a name and package of your own choice.
Generate a random integer in the range 0-9
Write a loop which runs five times
Use a Scanner instance to get user input (one character) on each loop iteration
If the entered text matches the random number, say "you win" and break out of the loop
If the loop completes all five iterations and they still didn't guess, say "you lose"

Things to consider:
Random() can return a number of useful things - see
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html
You will need to make the int into a string e.g. myStrg = "" + myInt
Make sure the required classes are imported

Optional
--------
Tell the user if their guess is higher or lower than the actual number
Provide a 'play again?' option ('N' would end the game)
Store each win or lose, along with the average number of guesses
Report on average guesses and number of goes won or lost after each game
