Java Additional Exercise 2
==========================
Create a class to encapsulate information about an image.
Properties should include string values for filename, photographer, category and description. (For some example data see week1_Java/data/photos.xml)
Write a getter method which derives the full image path from the filename, e.g.
  fullPath = "data/gallery" + filename + ".jpg"
Ensure the category is one of the following:
  people, city, abstract, nature, animals, miscellaneous, flowers
Anything other than those categories should default to miscellaneous

(You could import your Mock Data project to generate filenames and description data)

Create another class to represent a gallery (containing an array of Images)
Populate this gallery with a few image instances (using your Image class)
Write methods to order the array by filename, by category or by photographer

Invite the user to enter which ordering they want to see (including un-ordered) and output the image details in the chosen order

Optional
--------
Provide user options to show image details only from a specific category, or by a particular photographer
Also provide a search mechanism, where the user can enter some text and see files that match the search term
