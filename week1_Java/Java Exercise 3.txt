Java Exercise 3
===============
Use the Derby database to persist data about images
(You can use your Image project or create a new one, but add the derbyclient library)
For this exercise, the Derby network server must be running as usual (on port 1527)

In a new class (i.e, a new file) create a connection to the Derby network server
Write and execute SQL statements as follows:
Create a table with fields for id, filename, category, photographer and description
ID should be INT PRIMARY KEY, use VARCHAR(32) for all the other fields
Insert data about a few images (refer to data/photos.xml for examples)
Select the data fields and show them ( using rs.next() ). Show ALL fields

You can use the w3schools.com tutorial on SQL
Remember to comment out lines once they complete (i.e. create once, insert once)

Additional Exercise (if you completed the Image project)
--------------------------------------------------------
Every time a new Image instance is created, store the image details in this table
Provide options to create a new record, read, update and delete one record
Also provide options to show all records and to delete all records

Consider how you could implement database management options that might be needed,
such as finding images by category or by photographer etc.
