Java Review Exercise 4
======================
In this exercise you declare a weather interface then implement it in a class
You then create another class which extends the first class

Create a new project then create a new interface (in a new file) called IWeather

In the interface, declare methods getWeather() and showWeather() taking no parameters 

and returning void

Create a new class called WeatherReport (in a new file) which implements IWeather
Declare properties for city and country (both typed as strings)
You must also declare the methods required to satisfy the interface
Set city and country to sensible defaults (e.g. Galway, ie)
Inside getWeather() use println to output "Contacting weather server..."
Inside showWeather() say something like "cloudy, 9 degrees" concatenated with the city and country values

In the main method, create an instance of the WeatherReport and call both methods

Create a new class (in a new file) called WeatherForecast which extends WeatherReport
Declare the same properties and methods, then inside the methods, call super.method
The only difference is you will also output that this is a forecast prediction

Optional
--------
At run time pass in new values for city and country which override the defaults
