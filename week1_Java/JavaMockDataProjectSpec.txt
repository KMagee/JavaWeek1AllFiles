Java Project
============
If you would like to get on with a project using Java, try the following.

Mock Data project
-----------------
Create a new project (with any name you choose) which prints out properties containing random data of the following kind:
- a flag indicating on or off y

- an integer representing a persons age in years y

- a number for the quantity of data packets passing through a network node per year y

- something that resembles an email (i.e. has @ and a dot) - use random characters

- a string of between 8 and 12 random alpha-numeric characters of mixed case

- something representing a highly secure password up to 20 characters

Use the most efficient data type for each data member (estimate as needed!)

Optional
--------
Provide accessors and mutators to each data member
Also offer an array of programming language names, a combination of city/country and a structure containing name/address/phone data
